# Vibe31: The 31-Day AI App Building Challenge

## Core Promise

**"I'll show you how to clone the hottest AI apps using Vibe coding in 48 hours - apps making $20K-50K monthly right now."**

Transform from idea to shipped AI products this August.

---

## The Anti-Guru Truth

**You follow tech YouTubers, course creators, coding bootcamps...**

But while they're teaching theory, I'm in Vancouver actually shipping AI apps.

**The difference?**

- They teach concepts. I clone winners.
- They sell courses. I build products.
- They promise skills. I promise you'll ship this week.
- They show portfolios. I show live apps.
- They talk about AI. I actually use it to build.

**Here's what they won't tell you:**

I build AI apps every day using AI tools. The difference? I've systemized it into a repeatable process:

- **Find** viral AI apps
- **Reverse engineer** what makes them work
- **Clone** the essential features in 48 hours using AI
- **Iterate** and improve fast

**No coding bootcamp BS. Just: "Here's the viral app. Here's how to clone it. Now you build it."**

The main concept is simple: **Do not invent the wheel.** Reverse engineering & fast cloning - that's our entire process.

While they're updating their curriculum, I'm shipping my next AI app.

## Main Tool Stack

**The AI-Powered Stack That Builds Everything:**

- **Cursor**: The AI-powered IDE that writes code with you
- **Claude**: The language model that understands your vision
- **Supabase**: Database, auth, storage - everything backend
- **Vercel**: Deploy in seconds, scale to millions
- **Stripe**: Get paid immediately

**No complexity. No BS. Just AI tools that work.**

This exact stack has built 50+ AI apps. Nothing more needed.

## My Story (Why Listen to Me?)

Built a $600K dev agency in Korea. Hit $40K/month building custom apps.

Also built 40K YouTube subscribers by sharing EVERYTHING. No secrets. No paywalls. Just raw coding sessions.

But Korea was too small for my vision.

So I did something crazy:

**I quit everything. Moved to Vancouver. Locked myself in to master AI-powered development.**

Why Vancouver? Global market access. Better timezone for building worldwide.

Then I discovered something:

Using AI tools, I could build in 2 days what my dev team built in 2 months.

Started cloning viral apps instead of building from scratch. Same effort. 10X speed.

Now I build AI apps every day. Ship every week. Just like you want to do.

**The difference? I've turned chaos into system. Random ideas into proven viral clones.**

That's what I teach. Not theory. Not "learn to code." Just the exact reverse engineering and cloning system that works.

---

## Who This Is For

**Builders who:**

- Want to ship viral AI apps, not just learn about them
- Prefer cloning winners over building from scratch
- See AI as a building tool, not just a trend
- Ready to code with AI, not study algorithms
- Want to reverse engineer viral success, not reinvent wheels

**Not for:**

- "I need to learn fundamentals first" people
- Theory lovers who never ship
- Meeting addicts who don't code
- Anyone who hasn't tried Cursor yet

---

## The Math (Why This Works)

**Traditional App Development:**

- Custom app: 300 hours @ $100 = $30K
- Success rate: 10%
- Time to market: 6 months

**With AI-Powered Viral Cloning:**

- Clone viral app essentials: 20 hours using AI tools
- Success rate: 80% (proven viral concept)
- Time to market: 1 week
- Bonus: Build 3 apps = 3X chances to go viral

**Same vision. 15X faster. Actually ship.**

---

## Challenge Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Ship every week or forfeit**
2. **Use AI tools for 80% of coding**
3. **Help other builders succeed**
4. **No excuses, only execution**
5. **Clone essentials first, add features later**

**Challenge Rituals:**

- Thursday: Live builds together
- Friday: Submit for weekly prize
- Daily: Progress updates in Whop
- No theory. Just reverse engineering and shipping.

---

## Why Now?

**2025 is the year viral AI apps explode.**

- Users expect AI in every product
- AI tools make building 10X easier
- Viral apps get millions of users overnight
- Young builders get this. Old devs don't.

**Build now or compete with us later.**
